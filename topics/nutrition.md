# Nutrition Protocols

*Andrew Huberman's evidence-based nutrition guidelines*

---

## Core Principles

1. **Nutrient density over calorie counting** — prioritize whole foods
2. **Protein is foundational** — essential for muscle, satiety, and metabolism
3. **Timing matters** — circadian alignment affects digestion and metabolism
4. **Gut health = overall health** — fermented foods, fiber, diversity
5. **Consistency beats perfection** — sustainable habits over rigid rules

## Macronutrients

### Protein

**Daily Target:** 0.6g-1g per lb bodyweight
- For Grant (210 lbs): **130-210g/day**
- Minimum effective dose: ~100g/day for most adults

**Why it matters:**
- Muscle protein synthesis and repair
- Satiety (keeps you full longer)
- Thermic effect of food (burns more calories digesting)
- Hormonal health (precursor to neurotransmitters)

**Best sources:**
- Whey protein (40g post-workout optimal)
- Eggs (6g per egg)
- Greek yogurt (15-20g per cup)
- Lean meats, fish, poultry
- Legumes, tempeh (plant-based)

**Timing:**
- Distribute across 2-4 meals
- 30-50g per meal ideal for muscle protein synthesis
- Post-workout: 40g whey within 30-60 minutes

### Carbohydrates

**Approach:** Match to activity level

**Low-carb considerations:**
- Reduces cravings for many people
- Can improve mental clarity for some
- Not necessary for weight loss if protein is high

**Quality sources:**
- Whole grains (oats, quinoa, brown rice)
- Starchy vegetables (sweet potatoes, squash)
- Legumes
- Fruits (whole, not juice)

**Timing:**
- Front-load carbs earlier in day
- Reduce in evening for sleep quality
- Post-workout: replenish glycogen

### Fats

**Focus:** Healthy fats, adequate intake for hormones

**Prioritize:**
- Omega-3s (fatty fish, walnuts, flax)
- Monounsaturated (olive oil, avocados)
- Saturated in moderation (animal fats, coconut)

**Avoid:**
- Trans fats (processed foods)
- Excessive seed oils (high omega-6)

## Foods to Limit

### Refined Sugar

**Why limit:**
- Empty calories, spikes insulin
- Creates cravings cycle
- Associated with metabolic disease

**Approach:**
- Don't eliminate entirely (can lead to binging)
- Moderation: occasional treats, not daily
- Read labels—sugar hides everywhere

### Processed Foods

**Watch for:**
- Seed oils (soybean, corn, canola)
- Artificial sweeteners (mixed evidence)
- Trans fats
- High sodium

**Rule of thumb:**
- Shop the perimeter of grocery store
- If it has >5 ingredients or ones you can't pronounce, reconsider

### Excessive Alcohol

**Huberman's stance:**
- No amount is "healthy" (despite popular belief)
- If you drink, limit to 1-2 drinks
- Avoid daily drinking
- Major sleep disruptor

---

## Meal Timing & Circadian Nutrition

### Time-Restricted Eating (TRE)

**Huberman's approach:** 8-12 hour eating window

**Benefits:**
- Aligns with circadian rhythms
- Improves insulin sensitivity
- Supports cellular repair mechanisms
- May aid fat loss

**Common schedules:**
- **12:12** — Beginner friendly (eat 8am-8pm)
- **10:14** — Moderate (eat 10am-8pm)
- **8:16** — More aggressive (eat 12pm-8pm)

**Best practices:**
- Start your window 1-2 hours after waking
- End 3+ hours before bed for sleep quality
- Be consistent day-to-day
- Hydrate with electrolytes during fasted period

### Front-Loading Calories

**Morning:**
- Larger meals earlier
- More carbohydrates
- Caffeine (90-120 min after waking optimal)

**Evening:**
- Lighter meals
- Lower carbs, moderate protein
- Finish 2-3 hours before sleep

---

## Hydration Protocol

### Daily Targets

**Minimum:** 80 oz (2.4L) within 10 hours of waking

**Quality:**
- Filtered tap water (preferably removes fluoride)
- Hard water (calcium/magnesium) may benefit cardiovascular health
- Avoid plastic bottles (plastic leaches into water)

**Timing:**
- 16-32 oz immediately upon waking
- Spread throughout day
- Reduce 2 hours before bed for sleep

**During Exercise:**
- Add electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium)
- 7-10 oz every 15-20 min during intense training

---

## Gut Health

### The Importance

Gut microbiome affects:
- Immune function (70% of immune system in gut)
- Mental health (gut-brain axis)
- Metabolism and weight
- Inflammation levels

### Support Your Gut

**Fermented Foods (2+ servings/day):**
- Sauerkraut, kimchi
- Kefir, yogurt (low sugar)
- Kombucha (in moderation)
- Miso, tempeh

**Prebiotic Fiber:**
- Feeds beneficial bacteria
- Garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus
- Under-ripe bananas
- Chicory root

**Diversity:**
- Aim for 30+ different plant foods per week
- Variety = healthier microbiome
- Different colors, different benefits

**Avoid:**
- Unnecessary antibiotics
- Excessive NSAIDs
- Highly processed foods
- Artificial sweeteners (may disrupt microbiome)

---

## Supplements for Health

### Foundational (Daily)

**Omega-3 Fatty Acids:**
- Target: 1-2g combined EPA + DHA daily
- Benefits: Brain health, inflammation, mood
- Sources: Fish oil, krill oil, algae (vegan)

**Vitamin D3:**
- Test levels first (target 40-60 ng/mL)
- 2,000-5,000 IU if deficient
- Take with fat-containing meal
- Essential for immune function, mood, hormones

**Magnesium:**
- 300-400mg daily
- Forms: Glycinate (sleep/relaxation), Malate (energy)
- Benefits: 300+ enzymatic reactions, sleep quality

**Creatine Monohydrate:**
- 5g daily
- Benefits: Brain function, muscle performance
- Most researched supplement, very safe

### Optional/Conditional

**Ashwagandha:**
- 300-600mg daily
- Reduces cortisol, improves sleep
- Cycle: 8 weeks on, 2-4 weeks off

**Probiotics:**
- If gut issues present
- Choose multi-strain with 10-50 billion CFU
- Or just eat fermented foods instead

**Berberine:**
- 500mg 2-3x daily with meals
- Glucose management, mimics metformin
- Consult doctor if on medications

---

## Special Protocols

### Fasting Variations

**Intermittent Fasting:**
- See Time-Restricted Eating above
- Most sustainable for long-term

**Prolonged Fasting (24-72 hours):**
- Cellular autophagy (cleanup)
- Consider quarterly or biannually
- Medical supervision for 3+ days

**5:2 Protocol:**
- 5 days normal eating
- 2 days very low calorie (500-600 cal)
- Good for maintenance/flexibility

### Refeed Days

**When dieting:**
- 1 day per week at maintenance or slight surplus
- Higher carbs, still high protein
- Psychological break, leptin reset
- Prevents metabolic adaptation

---

## Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) & Metabolic Awareness

**Peter Attia's #1 recommendation for understanding your nutrition:** Wear a CGM for 2-4 weeks to see how your body actually responds to food.

### Why CGMs Matter

Standard blood tests give snapshots; CGMs reveal patterns:
- How specific foods spike YOUR glucose (individual variation is huge)
- The impact of sleep, stress, exercise on glucose
- Whether "healthy" foods work for you
- Real-time feedback on dietary changes

**Key insight:** Two people eating the same meal can have wildly different glucose responses.

### CGM Metrics to Track

**Fasting glucose:** Morning level before eating (target: 70-90 mg/dL)
**Peak post-meal:** Highest level 1-2 hours after eating (target: <140 mg/dL)
**Glucose variability:** How much you swing up and down (lower = better)
**Time in range:** % of day in 70-140 mg/dL (target: >90%)

### Glucose-Optimizing Strategies

**Eat foods in order (Jessie Inchauspé's method):**
1. Fiber (vegetables) first
2. Protein and fat second
3. Carbs last
**Effect:** Can reduce glucose spike by 30-75%

**Add vinegar:** 1-2 tbsp apple cider vinegar before carb-heavy meals lowers glucose response

**Move after meals:** 10-20 minute walk post-eating significantly blunts glucose spikes

**Don't eat "naked carbs":** Always pair carbohydrates with protein, fat, or fiber

**Protein at every meal:** Stabilizes glucose, increases satiety

### Foods That Spike Glucose (Common Surprises)

- Oatmeal (even "healthy" steel-cut)
- Smoothies (blending increases absorption speed)
- Grapes, watermelon, pineapple (high glycemic fruits)
- Rice cakes (highly processed, fast absorption)
- "Healthy" cereals and granola

### Foods That Stabilize Glucose

- Vinegar before meals
- Cinnamon (add to coffee, oatmeal)
- Avocado with carbs
- Legumes (beans slow glucose absorption)
- Berries vs. tropical fruits
- Whole intact grains vs. processed

### Practical CGM Experiment Protocol

**Week 1: Baseline**
- Eat normally, observe patterns
- Don't change anything
- Note your typical fasting and post-meal levels

**Week 2: Test Variables**
- Same breakfast, different order (carbs first vs. last)
- Same lunch, with vs. without 10-min walk after
- Same dinner, with vs. without vinegar before
- Sleep 6 hours vs. 8 hours, eat same breakfast

**Week 3: Optimize**
- Apply what you learned
- Test "hacks" that worked for you
- Build personalized meal templates

### When to Consider a CGM

- Pre-diabetes or diabetes risk
- Family history of metabolic disease
- Unexplained fatigue or brain fog
- Difficulty losing weight despite "eating healthy"
- Sleep issues (glucose and sleep are linked)
- Athletes optimizing performance
- Anyone serious about longevity

**Cost:** ~$70-300/month (FreeStyle Libre, Dexcom). Many find 2-4 weeks transformative even if not continuous.

## Eating for Specific Goals

### Fat Loss

**Keys:**
- Caloric deficit (300-500 cal/day sustainable)
- High protein (0.8-1g/lb) to preserve muscle
- High fiber for satiety
- Time-restricted eating
- Resistance training (non-negotiable)

**Don't:**
- Crash diet (ruins metabolism)
- Eliminate all carbs (unsustainable)
- Skip meals randomly (disrupts hunger cues)

### Muscle Gain

**Keys:**
- Slight surplus (200-300 cal/day) or maintenance with high protein
- 0.8-1g protein per lb bodyweight
- Adequate carbs to fuel training
- Consistent meal timing
- Progressive overload in training

**Surplus not required:**
- Huberman notes you can build muscle at maintenance with sufficient protein
- Beginners can even build in slight deficit

### Maintenance

**Keys:**
- Track for 2 weeks to find true maintenance
- Focus on food quality over quantity
- Flexible with timing
- Prioritize gut health and inflammation control

---

## Practical Implementation

### Meal Template

**Breakfast (if eating):**
- 40g protein (eggs, Greek yogurt, protein shake)
- Complex carbs (oats, fruit)
- Healthy fats (nuts, avocado)
- Example: 3 eggs + oatmeal with berries + walnuts

**Lunch:**
- 30-40g protein (chicken, fish, legumes)
- Large salad or vegetables
- Complex carbs (sweet potato, quinoa)
- Example: Salmon + big salad + olive oil + quinoa

**Dinner:**
- 30-40g protein
- Vegetables (2+ cups)
- Moderate carbs (or low if evening)
- Example: Steak + roasted broccoli + small sweet potato

**Snacks (if needed):**
- Greek yogurt
- Handful of nuts
- Protein shake
- Veggies with hummus

### Shopping List Staples

**Proteins:**
- Eggs, chicken, beef, fish
- Greek yogurt, cottage cheese

- Vegetables (everything, especially greens)

**Fats:**
- Olive oil, avocados
- Nuts (almonds, walnuts)
- Butter, coconut oil

**Fermented:**
- Sauerkraut, kimchi
- Kefir, yogurt
- Kombucha

### Eating Out Strategies

- Protein first, vegetables second
- Ask for dressings/sauces on side
- Grilled > fried
- Skip the bread basket (or limit)
- One indulgence, not three
- Don't drink your calories

## Troubleshooting

### Low Energy

**Check:**
- Total calories (may be too low)
- Carb timing (eat more earlier)
- Sleep quality (nutrition can't fix bad sleep)
- Hydration (often overlooked)
- Iron levels (especially if vegetarian)

### Poor Sleep

**Check:**
- Caffeine cutoff (10+ hours before bed)
- Meal timing (finish 3 hours before sleep)
- Alcohol (major disruptor)
- Magnesium intake
- Evening carbs (reduce or eliminate)

### Digestive Issues

**Check:**
- Fiber intake (may be too high too fast)
- Fermented foods (introduce gradually)
- Food sensitivities (common: dairy, gluten, FODMAPs)
- Eating speed (slow down)
- Stress levels (affects digestion)

### Hunger/Cravings

**Check:**
- Protein intake (likely too low)
- Fiber intake (increase vegetables)
- Sleep (poor sleep = more hunger hormones)
- Meal timing (try TRE)
- Are you actually hungry or just bored?

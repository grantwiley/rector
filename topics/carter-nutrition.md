# Carter's Nutrition Protocol

*Fertility-focused nutrition adapted from Huberman/Attia guidelines with female-specific priorities*

---

## Core Principles for Preconception

1. **Nourish, don't restrict** — This is not the time for aggressive dieting
2. **Blood sugar stability** — Foundation of hormone health
3. **Nutrient density** — Build stores for pregnancy
4. **Gut health** — Microbiome affects hormones, immunity, fertility
5. **Consistency beats perfection** — Sustainable habits matter

**Mantra:** "Eat for the baby you want to have."

## Fertility Nutrition Fundamentals

### Caloric Approach

**Never eat below needs:**
- Chronically under-fueling = amenorrhea = no ovulation
- Target: Maintenance or slight surplus (100-300 cal above baseline)
- TDEE estimate for Carter (~1,800-2,000 cal depending on activity)

**Signs you're under-fueling:**
- Missing or irregular periods
- Hair loss
- Constant coldness
- Low energy
- Poor sleep
- Obsessive food thoughts

### Macronutrients

#### Protein

**Daily Target:** 0.6-0.8g per lb bodyweight
- For Carter (135 lbs): **80-110g/day**
- Minimum for fertility: 60g (absolute floor)

**Why it matters:**
- Building blocks for hormones
- Egg quality
- Supports blood sugar stability

**Best fertility sources:**
- Eggs (choline for fetal brain development)
- Wild-caught salmon (omega-3s + protein)
- Grass-fed beef (iron, zinc, B12)
- Pasture-raised poultry
- Greek yogurt (probiotics + protein)
- Collagen peptides (glycine for methylation)

**Timing:**
- 25-35g per meal (3 meals + snack)
- Never skip protein at breakfast (sets blood sugar for day)
- Post-workout: 25-30g within 1-2 hours

#### Carbohydrates

**Quality over quantity:**
- Focus on complex carbs
- Pair with protein/fat (blood sugar stability)
- Front-load earlier in day

**Fertility-friendly carbs:**
- Sweet potatoes (beta-carotene)
- Quinoa (complete protein + fiber)
- Oats (soluble fiber)
- Legumes (fiber, folate, protein)
- Berries (low glycemic, antioxidants)
- Whole fruit (not juice)

**Limit:**
- Refined sugar (inflammation, blood sugar spikes)
- Processed grains (nutrient-depleted)
- Liquid carbs (smoothies spike glucose)

**Target:** 150-200g/day depending on activity (not low-carb)

#### Fats

**Critical for hormone production:**
- All sex hormones are made from cholesterol/fats
- Low-fat diets disrupt fertility

**Prioritize:**

*Omega-3s (anti-inflammatory, fetal brain):*
- Wild salmon, sardines, mackerel
- Walnuts, chia, flax
- Fish oil supplement (1-2g EPA+DHA)

*Monounsaturated (olive oil, avocados):*
- Extra virgin olive oil (cooking and dressing)
- Avocados (folate, potassium)

*Saturated (in moderation):*
- Pasture-raised butter/ghee
- Coconut oil
- Egg yolks

**Avoid:**
- Trans fats (processed foods)
- Excessive seed oils (omega-6 imbalance)

## Fertility Superfoods

### Daily Non-Negotiables

| Food | Amount | Why It Matters |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Eggs** | 2-3 daily | Choline (550mg needed), protein, DHA in yolks |
| **Leafy greens** | 2-3 cups | Folate, magnesium, calcium |
| **Berries** | 1 cup | Antioxidants, fiber, lower glycemic |
| **Fatty fish** | 3-4x/week | Omega-3s, protein, vitamin D |
| **Bone broth** | 1 cup | Glycine, minerals, gut healing |

### Weekly Targets

| Category | Target | Examples |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **Organ meats** | 1x/week | Liver (iron, B12, folate, retinol) |
| **Fermented foods** | Daily | Sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir |
| **Colorful vegetables** | 5+ cups/day | 10+ different types weekly |
| **Seeds** | 2 tbsp/day | Pumpkin (zinc), sesame (calcium), flax (fiber) |
| **Nuts** | Small handful | Walnuts (omega-3), Brazil nuts (selenium) |

### Liver: The Fertility Multivitamin

**Why it's unmatched:**
- Nature's most nutrient-dense food
- Iron (highly bioavailable)
- Vitamin A (retinol — different than beta-carotene)
- B12, folate, zinc, copper
- Choline

**How to eat:**
- 3-4 oz once per week
- Mix with ground beef (taco meat, meatloaf)
- Chicken liver is milder than beef
- Freeze-dried capsules if can't stomach fresh

**Note:** Don't overdo — vitamin A can be toxic in excess. Once weekly is perfect.

## Key Fertility Nutrients

### Folate vs. Folic Acid

**Critical distinction:**
- **Folic acid:** Synthetic form (40% of women can't metabolize)
- **Methylfolate (5-MTHF):** Active form — use this

**Food sources:**
- Liver (highest)
- Lentils, beans
- Asparagus
- Spinach, romaine
- Avocado

**Supplement:**
- Prenatal with 400-800mcg methylfolate
- NOT folic acid (check labels)

### Choline

**Most overlooked fertility nutrient:**
- 550mg/day needed pre-pregnancy
- 450mg/day during pregnancy
- Critical for fetal brain development

**Food sources:**
- Egg yolks (147mg per yolk) — 3 eggs = almost daily need
- Liver
- Salmon
- Cruciferous vegetables

**Supplement if not eating eggs:**
- Choline bitartrate or CDP-choline: 300-500mg

### Iron

**Target ferritin: 50-100 ng/mL**

**Food sources:**
- Red meat (heme iron — best absorbed)
- Liver
- Dark meat poultry
- Spinach, lentils (non-heme — less absorbed, pair with vitamin C)

**Enhance absorption:**
- Eat with vitamin C (citrus, peppers)
- Cook in cast iron
- Away from calcium, coffee, tea (inhibit absorption)

**Supplement only if needed:**
- Ferritin <30 ng/mL
- Bisglycinate form (gentlest)
- Every other day (better absorbed than daily)

### DHA/Omega-3

**Why it matters:**
- Fetal brain and eye development
- Reduces inflammation
- Supports hormone production
- May reduce preterm birth risk

**Food sources:**
- Wild salmon (2-3x/week)
- Sardines
- Anchovies
- Pasture-raised eggs

**Supplement:**
- Fish oil: 1-2g combined EPA+DHA
- Look for third-party tested (IFOS, NSF)
- Algae oil if vegetarian/vegan

### Vitamin D

**Target: 40-60 ng/mL**

**Functions:**
- Hormone synthesis (it's a hormone)
- Egg quality
- Implantation
- Immune regulation

**Food sources:**
- Fatty fish
- Pasture-raised eggs
- Sun exposure (UVB)

**Supplement:**
- D3: 2,000-5,000 IU based on blood levels
- Take with fat-containing meal
- Recheck levels quarterly

### Zinc

**Critical for:**
- Egg quality
- Hormone production
- DNA synthesis
- Immune function

**Food sources:**
- Oysters (highest — 6 = daily need)
- Red meat
- Pumpkin seeds
- Cashews

**Target:** 15-30mg daily from food + prenatal

### Selenium

**Why it matters:**
- Thyroid function (converts T4 to T3)
- Antioxidant protection
- May reduce miscarriage risk

**Easy source:**
- 2-3 Brazil nuts per day = perfect amount
- Don't overdo (toxic in excess)

### CoQ10

**For egg quality (especially >30):**
- Supports mitochondrial function
- Eggs are the largest cells — need massive energy
- May improve fertility outcomes

**Dose:**
- 100-200mg daily
- Ubiquinol form (better absorbed)
- Take with fat

### Glycine

**Underrated for fertility:**
- Needed for methylation (MTHFR support)
- Collagen synthesis (uterine lining)
- Detoxification
- Sleep quality

**Sources:**
- Bone broth
- Collagen peptides (add to coffee/smoothies)
- Skin-on poultry
- Meat with connective tissue

## Meal Timing & Circadian Nutrition

### Front-Load the Day

**Breakfast (7-9 AM):**
- Largest meal or substantial
- 30-40g protein
- Complex carbs
- Healthy fats
- Example: 3 eggs + avocado + sweet potato

**Lunch (12-2 PM):**
- Moderate meal
- 30g protein
- Large salad/vegetables
- Example: Salmon + quinoa + roasted vegetables

**Dinner (6-8 PM):**
- Lighter meal
- 25-30g protein
- Mostly vegetables
- Limit carbs for sleep quality
- Example: Chicken + big salad + olive oil

### Time-Restricted Eating (Modified)

**Standard approach:**
- 10-12 hour eating window
- Start 1-2 hours after waking
- End 3+ hours before bed

**Fertility modification:**
- Don't fast >12 hours (can stress hormones)
- Always eat within 1 hour of waking
- Never skip breakfast
- Evening meal important for progesterone production

## Foods to Prioritize

### Vegetables (5+ cups/day)

**Cruciferous (support estrogen metabolism):**
- Broccoli
- Cauliflower
- Brussels sprouts
- Cabbage
- Bok choy

**Leafy greens (folate, magnesium):**
- Spinach
- Kale
- Swiss chard
- Romaine
- Arugula

**Colorful (antioxidants):**
- Beets
- Carrots
- Bell peppers
- Tomatoes
- Sweet potatoes

### Fermented Foods (Daily)

**Why:** Gut health = hormone health
- Sauerkraut
- Kimchi
- Kefir
- Plain yogurt
- Kombucha (moderation)

### Quality Proteins

**Prioritize:**
- Pasture-raised eggs
- Wild-caught fish
- Grass-fed beef
- Pasture-raised poultry
- Organic when possible

**Why quality matters:**
- Higher omega-3s in pasture-raised
- Fewer hormones/antibiotics
- Better fatty acid profile

---

## Foods to Limit or Avoid

### Preconception Eliminations

**Alcohol:**
- Complete elimination
- Fetal alcohol syndrome risk starts before you know you're pregnant
- Even "moderate" drinking affects fertility

**High-Mercury Fish:**
- Shark, swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish
- Limit tuna (choose light vs. white)
- Safe: salmon, sardines, anchovies, trout

**Excess Caffeine:**
- Limit to <200mg/day (1-2 cups coffee)
- Some studies link higher caffeine to miscarriage
- Switch to half-caf or tea in afternoon

### Reduce Significantly

**Refined sugar:**
- Inflammation
- Blood sugar spikes
- Disrupts gut microbiome
- Keep to occasional treats (not daily)

**Processed foods:**
- Seed oils (inflammation)
- Artificial sweeteners (gut disruption)
- Trans fats
- Chemical additives

**Soy (controversial):**
- Some concern about phytoestrogens
- Fermented soy (miso, tempeh) likely fine
- Limit processed soy (soy protein isolate)

### Endocrine Disruptors in Food

**Avoid:**
- Non-organic dairy (hormones)
- Non-organic animal fats (toxins concentrate in fat)
- Canned foods (BPA lining)
- Plastic food storage (especially heating)
- Pesticide-heavy produce (Dirty Dozen — buy organic)

---

## Hydration Protocol

### Daily Targets

**Minimum:** 80 oz (2.4L) within 10 hours of waking

**Sources:**
- Filtered water (preferably removes fluoride)
- Herbal teas (red raspberry leaf — uterine tonic)
- Bone broth
- Mineral water

**Morning:**
- 16-20 oz upon waking
- Add lemon or pinch of sea salt

**Avoid:**
- Plastic water bottles (chemical leaching)
- Excess fluids before bed (progesterone is diuretic)

---

## Gut Health for Fertility

### The Gut-Hormone Connection

**Why it matters:**
- Gut bacteria metabolize estrogens
- Inflammation in gut = inflammation everywhere
- 70% of immune system in gut (pregnancy is immune shift)
- Nutrient absorption depends on gut health

### Support Your Gut

**Eat daily:**
- 25-30g fiber minimum
- 2+ servings fermented foods
- Diverse plant foods (30+ types/week)
- Prebiotic foods (garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus)

**Avoid:**
- Unnecessary antibiotics
- Excessive NSAIDs
- Highly processed foods
- Artificial sweeteners

**Consider:**
- Probiotic supplement if history of antibiotics or gut issues
- Soil-based probiotics (SBO) may be beneficial

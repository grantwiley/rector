---

## Foundational Fitness Protocol

Huberman's weekly protocol covering all major fitness domains. **Keep workouts to 50-60 minutes max (75 min absolute maximum)** to optimize recovery and avoid excess cortisol.

**For longevity (Peter Attia's Centenarian Decathlon framework):** The goal is maintaining physical function into your 90s and 100s—training for the "marginal decade" so you can lift a grandchild, hike, play sports, and live independently.

### Weekly Structure

| Day | Focus | Details |
|-----|-------|---------|
| **Day 1 (Sunday)** | Zone 2 Cardio | 30-75 min at conversational pace (jog, row, bike, swim, hike). Aim for 180-200 min Zone 2 per week total. |
| **Day 2 (Monday)** | Legs Resistance | 10-min warmup + 50-60 min training. Alternate Schedule A & B monthly. |
| **Day 3 (Tuesday)** | Active Recovery | Light activity, mobility work, or rest |
| **Day 4 (Wednesday)** | Torso & Neck | Indirectly trains arms. 10-min warmup + 50-60 min. |
| **Day 5 (Thursday)** | HIIT Cardio | 20-30 min high-intensity intervals |
| **Day 6 (Friday)** | Arms, Calves, Neck, Abs | Isolation work for smaller muscle groups |
| **Day 7 (Saturday)** | Rest or Light Activity | Full rest or gentle movement |

## Zone 2 Cardio Deep Dive

**Peter Attia calls this the most important training modality for longevity.** Zone 2 trains mitochondrial health and metabolic efficiency—key for avoiding the metabolic dysfunction that kills most people.

### What is Zone 2?

The highest intensity where you're still primarily using oxygen to burn fat (not carbs). You should be able to hold a conversation but feel slightly challenged.

**Signs you're in Zone 2:**
- Can speak in full sentences but wouldn't want to
- Nose breathing is comfortable
- Heart rate ~60-70% max (or use "180 minus age" formula)
- You could sustain this for hours

### Why Zone 2 Matters (Attia's Framework)

- **Mitochondrial health:** Zone 2 stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis (making more power plants)
- **Metabolic efficiency:** Improves fat oxidation, metabolic flexibility
- **Lactate clearance:** Trains your body to clear lactate efficiently
- **Foundation for everything:** You can't train VO2 max effectively without a Zone 2 base

### Protocol

| Weekly Target | Per Session | Duration |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **Minimum:** 180 min/week | 30-45 min | 4 sessions |
| **Optimal:** 240-300 min/week | 45-60 min | 4-5 sessions |
| **Maximum:** 5-6 hours/week | 60 min | Most benefit tapers here |

**Attia's 80/20 Rule:** 80% of cardio time should be Zone 2, 20% higher intensity.

### Best Modalities

- **Stationary bike with power meter:** Most precise (monitor watts, keep steady)
- **Rucking:** Walking with weighted backpack (20-30 lbs)
- **Rowing, elliptical, swimming:** Low impact, sustainable
- **Jogging:** If you can stay conversational

**Huberman/Attia preference:** Stationary bike for precise Zone 2 control.

### Measuring Zone 2

**Option 1: Heart Rate (approximate)**
- Zone 2 ≈ 60-70% of max heart rate
- Formula: 180 minus your age
- For Grant (24): ~156 bpm max, Zone 2 ≈ 120-140 bpm

**Option 2: Lactate Meter (Attia's preference)**
- Zone 2 = 1.5-2.0 mmol/L lactate
- Lactate Plus meter (~$150)
- Most accurate method

**Option 3: Talk Test**
- Can talk in sentences but wouldn't want to
- If you're gasping for air, you're above Zone 2

### Resistance Training Principles

**Periodization (Alternate monthly):**

**Schedule A (Strength):**
- 4-8 reps per set (heavier weights)
- 3-4 sets per exercise
- 2-4 minutes rest between sets

**Schedule B (Hypertrophy):**
- 8-15 reps per set (moderate-lighter weights)
- 2-3 sets per exercise
- ~90 seconds rest between sets

**Exercise Selection (per muscle group):**
- Exercise #1: Shortened/maximally contracted position (e.g., leg curl, seated calf raise, bicep preacher curl, leg extension)
- Exercise #2: Lengthened position (e.g., standing calf raises, incline dumbbell curls, deep squats, glute-ham raises)

---

## VO2 Max Training (Attia Protocol)

**VO2 max is the single best predictor of longevity—better than cholesterol, blood pressure, or smoking status.** Peter Attia calls it "the most important marker for healthspan."

### What is VO2 Max?

Maximum volume of oxygen your body can use per minute. It reflects your cardiovascular fitness ceiling and predicts how long you'll live and function independently.

**Age-related decline:** VO2 max drops ~10% per decade after 30. Training can slow this dramatically.

### Why It Matters for Longevity

- Predicts all-cause mortality better than any other metric
- Determines your "marginal decade" quality of life
- Maintains optionality for physical activities into old age
- Cardiovascular fitness = healthspan

### The 4×4 Protocol (Attia's Gold Standard)

**The protocol:**
1. Warm up: 10-15 minutes easy
2. Work interval: 4 minutes at maximum sustainable effort
3. Rest interval: 4 minutes easy recovery
4. Repeat: 4-6 rounds
5. Cool down: 5-10 minutes

**Key points:**
- "Maximum sustainable" = hardest you can hold for 4 minutes
- This is hard. You're not cruising; you're working.
- RPE (rate of perceived exertion): 8-9/10
- Heart rate isn't reliable here—go by feel

### Simpler Alternatives

**Beginner:** 4 × 3 minutes work / 3 minutes rest
**Intermediate:** 4-6 × 4 minutes work / 4 minutes rest
**Advanced:** 3 × 8 minutes work / 4 minutes rest

**Total weekly target:** 20-30 minutes of hard Zone 5 work (usually 1-2 sessions)

### Best Modalities

- **Stationary bike:** Safest, easiest to control
- **Running:** High impact, high reward
- **Rowing:** Full body, less impact
- **Swimming:** Joint-friendly, great if you have access

**Attia's preference:** Bike (controlled, safe, measurable)

### Progression

**Month 1-2:** Start with 3-4 minute intervals
**Month 3-4:** Progress to 4-5 intervals
**Month 5+:** Try longer intervals (6-8 min) or add sessions

**Rule:** Only add intensity OR volume—not both at once.

### Testing Your VO2 Max

**Lab testing:** Gold standard, costs $100-300
**Cooper's 12-minute test:** Run as far as you can in 12 minutes, use online calculator
**Wearables:** Apple Watch, Garmin, WHOOP estimate (less accurate but trending)

**Age-adjusted targets (Attia):**
- Age 20-29: >50 ml/kg/min (men), >40 (women)
- Age 30-39: >48 ml/kg/min (men), >38 (women)
- Age 40-49: >44 ml/kg/min (men), >35 (women)

**Bottom line:** Higher is better. Train it early and often.

## Stability Training: The Missing Pillar

**Most overlooked component of longevity fitness.** Without stability, strength and cardio capacity are useless—you'll fall, get injured, or move poorly.

### Why Stability Matters

- Reduces injury risk
- Improves movement quality
- Enables safe strength training
- Critical for balance as you age
- Foundation for everything else

### Attia's Stability Framework

**Minimum effective dose:** 10 minutes daily

**Weekly structure:**
- 5-7 days: 10 min daily stability work
- 1 day: Longer 30-60 min dedicated stability session

### Stability Exercises

**Fundamental movements:**
1. **Turkish get-up:** Ultimate stability exercise (learn from coach)
2. **Single-leg Romanian deadlift:** Balance + posterior chain
3. **Cossack squat:** Hip mobility + stability
4. **90/90 hip switch:** Hip rotation control
5. **Plank variations:** Core bracing
6. **Dead bug:** Core stability with limb movement
7. **Farmer carries:** Loaded walking stability
8. **Single-leg stands:** Basic balance (close eyes for challenge)

**Huberman favorite:** 1-2 minutes of balance work before heavy lifts (wakes up stabilizers)

### Integration

- Do 5-10 min before strength training (movement prep)
- Sprinkle throughout day (stand on one leg while brushing teeth)
- Use as active recovery between sets

## Cold Exposure Protocols (Huberman)

Deliberate cold exposure activates brown fat, boosts metabolism, enhances mood, and builds mental resilience.

### Key Benefits

- **Brown fat activation:** Increases metabolic rate, improves glucose disposal
- **Dopamine boost:** 250% increase in baseline dopamine (sustained for hours)
- **Norepinephrine:** 530% increase—enhances focus, mood, alertness
- **Inflammation reduction:** Cools inflammatory pathways
- **Mental resilience:** Teaches nervous system regulation

### The Protocol

**Temperature:** 37-60°F (3-15°C)
**Weekly target:** 11 minutes total across 2-4 sessions
**Per session:** 2-5 minutes (start shorter, build up)

**Progression:**
- Week 1-2: 1-2 minutes per session
- Week 3-4: 2-3 minutes per session
- Month 2+: 3-5 minutes per session

### Best Practices

**Safety first:**
- Never cold plunge alone initially
- Cold shock response is real—start slow
- Don't hyperventilate before or during

**Time of day:**
- **Morning:** Increases wakefulness, body temperature
- **Avoid:** Within 4-6 hours of strength training (blunts muscle growth)
- **Avoid:** Late evening (too alerting, disrupts sleep)

**Søberg Principle:**
- End on cold
- Let body reheat naturally (no hot shower after)
- Forces brown fat activation

**Movement during cold:**
- Move hands/feet to generate heat
- Don't just sit still
- Stay uncomfortable but safe

### Methods

**Cold shower:** Easiest to start (end shower with 1-2 min cold)
**Cold plunge:** Most effective (immersion up to neck)
**Ice bath:** Advanced (full submersion with ice)

## Heat Exposure / Sauna Protocols (Huberman)

Deliberate heat exposure mimics cardiovascular exercise, releases growth hormone, reduces stress, and improves mood.

### Key Benefits

- **Cardiovascular:** Reduces heart disease risk by 27% (2-3x/week), up to 50% (4-7x/week)
- **Growth hormone:** Specific protocol increases GH 16-fold
- **Cortisol reduction:** Lowers stress hormone
- **Mood enhancement:** Activates dynorphin pathways (natural opioids)
- **Heat shock proteins:** Cellular protection and repair
- **Improved sleep:** If done in late afternoon/early evening

### General Protocol

**Temperature:** 80-100°C (176-212°F) for dry sauna; slightly lower for steam
**Weekly target:** 57 minutes total across 2-7 sessions
**Per session:** 5-20 minutes

**Optimal frequency:** 3-4 sessions per week (20 min each)

### Time of Day

**Best:** Late afternoon/early evening (4-6 PM)
- Mimics natural body temperature decline
- Aids sleep
- Huberman's preference

**Avoid:** Immediately post-strength training (heat + lifting = extra stress)
**Can do:** Post-cardio, on rest days, before bed

### The Growth Hormone Protocol (Advanced)

**Protocol for 16x GH release:**
- 30 min sauna session
- Cool down to baseline
- Repeat: 3-4 rounds in single day
- Do 1-2x per month maximum (more is not better)

**Warning:** This is stressful. Only if you're well-adapted to sauna.

### Best Practices

**Hydration:**
- Pre-hydrate: 16-32 oz water before
- Electrolytes during/after (sodium, magnesium, potassium)
- Sauna causes significant fluid loss

**Safety:**
- Never exceed 20 min without cooling break
- Exit if dizzy, nauseous, or uncomfortable
- Don't lock sauna door
- Cool shower or plunge between rounds if doing multiples

**Progression:**
- Start: 5-10 minutes per session
- Build to: 15-20 minutes per session
- Frequency: 2x/week → 4x/week over months

### Contrast: Heat + Cold

**Protocol:**
1. Sauna: 15-20 min
2. Cold plunge/shower: 2-3 min
3. Repeat 2-3 rounds
4. End on cold (Søberg principle)

**Benefits:** Maximizes both heat shock and cold shock proteins

## The Centenarian Decathlon Framework (Attia)

**The concept:** Define 10-20 physical tasks you want to do at age 100, then train backwards from there.

### Examples of Decathlon Events

**Activities of daily living:**
- Lift a 30-lb child from floor
- Carry groceries up stairs
- Get up from floor without hands
- Walk 3 miles continuously

**Recreational:**
- Hike a steep trail
- Play with grandkids
- Travel independently
- Swim laps

### The 4 Pillars of Longevity Training

| Pillar | Weekly Minimum | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Zone 2** | 180 min | Mitochondrial health, metabolic efficiency |
| **VO2 Max** | 20-30 min | Cardiovascular ceiling, mortality predictor |
| **Strength** | 2-3 sessions | Muscle mass, bone density, function |
| **Stability** | 10 min daily | Injury prevention, movement quality, balance |

**Attia's minimum effective dose:**
- 1 hour Zone 2
- 1 hour strength
- 20-30 min VO2 max
- 10 min daily stability

### Training Philosophy

**Backcasting (not forecasting):**
- Don't guess what you'll need at 100
- Define it specifically now
- Train backwards from those specific capabilities

**Specificity matters:**
- Want to hike? Train hiking.
- Want to lift grandkids? Train loaded carries.
- Want to travel? Train walking with luggage.

**Time, intensity, specificity:** All three required for the marginal decade.

### Breathing During Training

- **Between sets:** Use physiological sighs — two full inhales through nose, followed by one full exhale through mouth
- **Post-workout:** 3-5 minutes of deliberate slow breathing to downshift nervous system and aid recovery

### Training Fast vs. Fed

Huberman prefers training fasted (after caffeine, water, and electrolytes) but before noon. However, timing matters less than consistency — train when you can, even if you just ate.

## Stretching Protocols

Flexibility declines ~10% per decade from age 20-49. **Consistency beats intensity** — "microstretching" at 30-40% intensity is more effective than painful stretching.

### Static Stretching Protocol

**Goal:** General flexibility improvement
- 2-4 sets of 30-second holds per muscle group
- 5 days per week minimum
- Target: 5 minutes per muscle group per week total
- Can hold longer (60 seconds) to reduce frequency

**Best practices:**
- Hold static stretches 30-60 seconds per position
- Do at night before sleep or during waiting times
- Long exhales deepen the stretch
- Consistency > intensity (don't push to pain)

### PNF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation) Protocol

**Goal:** Increase flexibility of targeted muscles for athletics
- Combines stretching and contracting
- Partner-assisted for best results
- Leverages spindle fibers and Golgi tendon organs

### Antagonistic Muscle Group Protocol

**Goal:** Reduce injury risk pre-exercise
- Alternate exercises of opposing muscle groups (flexors/extensors)
- Example: Pull-ups (back/biceps) → Bench press (chest/triceps)
- Allows autogenic inhibition — contraction of one muscle "relaxes" the antagonist

## Supplements for Fitness & Performance

### Pre-Workout (30-60 min before)

**Alpha-GPC:** 300mg
- Promotes acetylcholine release
- Increases power output

**L-Tyrosine:** 500mg
- Increases dopamine production
- Enhances energy, motivation, mood

**Caffeine:** 
- 1-3 mg per kg body weight
- Enhances dopamine effect of exercise
- Improves reaction time and recall
- Delay 90-120 min after waking if afternoon crashes occur

**Rhodiola Rosea:**
- Reduces stress, improves performance under stress
- Enhances work capacity and recovery on intense workouts

### Daily

**Creatine Monohydrate:** 5g daily
- Most well-researched supplement
- Increases exercise performance, possibly cognition
- Increases testosterone and DHT conversion

### Post-Workout (30-60 min after)

**Whey Protein:** 40g
- Well-absorbed protein source
- Benefits muscle gain and fat loss

### General Health

**Omega-3 Fatty Acids:**
- Aim for 1g+ EPA + DHA
- Up to 2g EPA shown beneficial
- Reduces depression, improves cognition

**Ashwagandha:**
- Reduces cortisol (stress)
- Modestly increases testosterone
- Aids sleep and lean mass

**Testosterone Optimization Stack (for men):**
- Tongkat Ali: 400mg/day (morning — stimulant effect)
- Fadogia Agrestis: 425mg/day (cycle 8 weeks on/2 weeks off)
- Boron: 5-12mg/day
- Vitamin D: if deficient
- Avoid excess turmeric (inhibits testosterone → DHT conversion)

## Nutrition Guidelines

### Macronutrients

**Protein:**
- 0.6g-1g per lb bodyweight per day for muscle gain
- No need to "bulk" — can eat at maintenance with sufficient protein
- Whey protein post-workout: 40g

**Fiber:**
- 25g per day minimum for health and longevity

### Foods to Emphasize

- Whole foods (high nutrient density)
- Fruits and veggies: 500-600g per day
- Whole grains
- Healthy fats (nuts, seeds, fatty fish)
- Sufficient protein
- Dairy products
- Low-sugar fermented foods (gut health)

### Foods to Limit

**Refined Sugar:**
- High calories, low nutrients
- Chronic overconsumption associated with diabetes, heart disease, cancer
- Creates cravings for more sugar
- Complete abstention can lead to binging — moderate approach better

### Hydration

- Filter tap water (preferably removes fluoride)
- Aim for 80 oz within 10 hours of waking
- Hard water (high calcium/magnesium) may benefit cardiovascular health
- Avoid plastic bottles (plastic leaches into water)
- Electrolytes during exercise to offset dehydration

---

## Training Obstacles & Modifications

### Illness/Mild Cold

- Light training at 50% intensity/duration may help
- Skip entirely if truly sick
- Ramp back up slowly over 3-7 days after recovery

### Poor Sleep/High Stress

- Consider skipping unless workout will help reset
- Prioritize sleep
- Try prayer, Scripture reading, or Lectio Divina
- Double up workouts later in week if needed

### Missed Sessions

- Can double up on workouts later in week
- Can swap days (e.g., Day 4 and 5)
- Consistency over perfection

---

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **Keep workouts under 60 min** — prevents excess cortisol and aids recovery
2. **3-5 min downregulation breathing** post-workout activates parasympathetic nervous system
3. **Rest days:** Include prayer, Scripture reading, or simply resting
4. **Static stretching:** 5 min/muscle group/week minimum, ideally daily
5. **Zone 2 cardio:** 180-200 min per week total (can be multiple sessions)

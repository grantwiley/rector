## Sleep Toolkit

Sleep is the foundation of mental and physical health. These are the non-negotiables.

### Morning Protocol (Most Important)

**View sunlight within 30-60 minutes of waking:**
- Bright cloudless day: 10 minutes
- Cloudy day: 20 minutes
- Very overcast day: 30-60 minutes
- If you wake before sunrise: turn on artificial lights, go outside once sun rises
- No sunglasses (if safe), but contacts/glasses are fine
- Never look directly at sun or any light painful to view
- Windows filter essential wavelengths — outdoor light is 50x more effective

**Winter/Limited Sunlight Alternative:**
- Use SAD lamp or light box (not as effective as natural sun but helpful)
- Place at desk in morning
- Lux meter app can measure intensity (cloudy day outdoors = ~1,000 lux; indoors = ~100 lux)

**If you miss a day:** Double the duration next day

### Evening Protocol (Second Most Important)

**Avoid bright light 10pm-4am:**
- Use only as much artificial light as necessary for safety
- Blue blockers help but dimming lights is more important
- All bright light colors are problematic for circadian system
- Candlelight and moonlight are fine
- Keep lights low in the room (less harmful than overhead)
- Viewing bright lights during this window disrupts dopamine, serotonin, other neuromodulators

### Sleep Environment

**Temperature:**
- Keep room cool (body must drop 1-3°C to fall and stay asleep)
- Use blankets you can remove
- Too hot = harder to sleep than too cold

**Darkness:**
- Keep room as dark as possible
- Remove or cover light sources

### Caffeine Timing

- **Avoid caffeine 8-10 hours before bedtime**
- Dr. Matt Walker (sleep expert) suggests 12-14 hours for some
- Huberman's example: caffeine at 2pm, sleep at 10-11pm works fine
- Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors (adenosine makes us sleepy)

### Alcohol & Sleep Medications

- **Alcohol messes up sleep** — disrupts REM, fragment sleep
- Most sleep medications have similar problems
- Occasional use is fine, but regular use is detrimental

### Naps

- Keep under 90 minutes (won't disrupt sleep cycle)
- Huberman naps 30-45 min most afternoons
- Can help but not required

### Waking in the Night

**Normal to wake once per night.** If you can't fall back asleep:
- Try prayer — The Jesus Prayer, Psalm 23, or the Night Office
- Keep a prayer book or Bible by your bed
- Use this time for intercession — pray for family, parish, or those in need

### Pre-Sleep Alertness Spike

**Expect to feel alert ~1 hour before natural bedtime** — this is normal circadian rhythm.
- Don't panic if it happens
- It will pass
- Don't push through sleepiness and go to bed too late (causes 3am wake-ups)

### Sleep Supplements (Optional)

Start with one, add others as needed. Take 30-60 min before bed:

**Core Stack:**
- Magnesium Threonate: 145mg OR Magnesium Bisglycinate: 200mg
- Apigenin: 50mg (also found in chamomile tea)
- Theanine: 100-400mg

**Additional (3-4 nights/week):**
- Glycine: 2g
- GABA: 100mg

**Notes:**
- Don't take theanine if you have overly intense dreams, sleep-walk, or night terrors
- ~5% of people get agitated stomach from magnesium — skip if this happens
- Huberman does NOT recommend melatonin (disrupts natural production)

### Sleep Regularity

**Consistency matters more than exact duration:**
- Wake up at same time every day
- Go to sleep when you first feel sleepy
- Limit day-to-day variation
- 80% compliance is the goal (perfection not required)

### Sleep Needs Change

- May need 6 hours in summer, 7-8 in winter
- May be night owl at 15, morning person later in life
- Adjust accordingly

## Metabolic Health & Glucose Monitoring (Attia Protocols)

**Metabolic dysfunction drives most age-related diseases:** type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's. Peter Attia calls metabolic health "the most underappreciated pillar of longevity."

### The Problem

- **Insulin resistance:** Cells stop responding to insulin, glucose stays high
- **Prevalence:** ~88% of Americans have some degree of metabolic dysfunction
- **Consequences:** Heart disease (#1 killer), stroke, cancer, dementia

### Key Markers to Track

| Marker | Optimal Range | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Fasting Glucose** | 70-90 mg/dL | Morning blood sugar before eating |
| **HbA1c** | <5.3% | 3-month glucose average |
| **Fasting Insulin** | <6 μIU/mL | How hard your pancreas is working |
| **HOMA-IR** | <1.0 | Insulin resistance calculation |
| **Triglycerides** | <100 mg/dL | Blood fat levels |
| **HDL** | >60 mg/dL | "Good" cholesterol |

**Attia's stance:** Fasting insulin is more important than glucose. You can have "normal" glucose but high insulin (your pancreas is compensating).

### Glucose Monitoring Strategies

**Option 1: Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)**
- **What it is:** Wearable sensor (arm patch) measuring glucose 24/7
- **Cost:** $70-300/month without insurance
- **Brands:** FreeStyle Libre, Dexcom
- **Duration:** 2-4 weeks for baseline, periodically for optimization

**Attia's view:** CGMs are "transformational" for understanding your metabolic response to food, exercise, sleep, stress.

**What you'll learn:**
- Which foods spike your glucose (surprises: oatmeal, some fruits)
- How sleep deprivation affects glucose
- How exercise blunts glucose spikes
- Stress = glucose spikes even without food
- The order you eat matters (protein/fiber first)

**Option 2: Fingerstick Glucometer**
- Cheaper alternative ($30 + strips)
- Measure fasting morning glucose
- Test before and 1-2 hours after meals
- Less convenient, less data, but useful

### Using a CGM: Practical Guide

**Week 1: Baseline**
- Eat normally, see your patterns
- Note: fasting glucose, post-meal peaks, bedtime levels
- Don't change anything yet

**Week 2: Experiments**
- Test one variable at a time:
  - Same meal, different order of eating
  - Same food, with/without walk after
  - Same food, with/without vinegar before
  - Sleep deprived vs. well-rested eating

**Key metrics to track:**
1. **Fasting glucose:** Morning before eating (goal: <100 mg/dL, ideally <90)
2. **Peak post-meal:** 1-2 hours after eating (goal: <140 mg/dL)
3. **Glucose variability:** Swings up and down (lower = better)
4. **Time in range:** 70-140 mg/dL (goal: >90%)

### Optimizing Glucose Control

**Dietary strategies:**
- **Protein first:** Eat protein/fat before carbs at each meal
- **Fiber front-loading:** Start meals with vegetables
- **Vinegar:** 1-2 tbsp apple cider vinegar before carb-heavy meals
- **Walk after meals:** 10-20 min walk post-eating lowers glucose spike
- **Limit liquid carbs:** Juice, soda, even smoothies spike glucose fast

**Exercise:**
- Zone 2 cardio improves insulin sensitivity
- Resistance training builds glucose-consuming muscle
- Post-meal movement matters most

**Sleep:**
- One bad night of sleep = insulin resistance next day
- Consistent sleep schedule improves metabolic health

**Stress:**
- Cortisol releases glucose (even without eating)
- Meditation, breathing reduce glucose variability

### Target Metrics (Attia's Standards)

| Metric | Good | Optimal | Concerning |
|--------|------|---------|------------|
| **Fasting glucose** | <100 | 70-90 | >100 |
| **Post-meal peak** | <140 | <120 | >160 |
| **Time in range** | >85% | >90% | <70% |
| **Glucose variability** | Low | Very low | High swings |

### When to Worry

**See a doctor if:**
- Fasting glucose consistently >110 mg/dL
- Post-meal peaks >180 mg/dL
- HbA1c >5.7%
- Fasting insulin >10 μIU/mL
- Family history of diabetes + any warning signs

### The "Glucose Goddess" Hacks (Jessie Inchauspé)

1. **Eat food in the right order:** Fiber → Protein/Fat → Carbs
2. **Add vinegar:** 1 tbsp before carb-heavy meals
3. **Move after eating:** 10 min walk post-meal
4. **Don't eat naked carbs:** Always pair carbs with protein/fat/fiber
5. **Savory breakfast:** Skip sweet breakfast, eat protein + vegetables

## Prayer & Spiritual Discipline (ACNA Perspective)

The Daily Office provides the foundation for Christian spiritual life. Prayer is not merely relaxation—it is communion with God, petition for others, and formation of the soul.

### The Daily Office

**Morning Prayer (Matins)**
- Ideally at sunrise or within first hour of waking
- 20-30 minutes
- Structure: Opening Sentences, Confession, Psalms, Scripture Reading, Canticles, Lord's Prayer, Collects, Intercessions
- Resources: *The Book of Common Prayer (2019)*, Venite app, or prayer books

**Evening Prayer (Vespers)**
- Before or after dinner, or at sunset
- 20-30 minutes
- Similar structure to Morning Prayer
- Helps mark the transition from work to rest
- Prepares the mind and soul for sleep

**Night Prayer (Compline)**
- Last thing before bed
- 10-15 minutes
- Shortest office, focuses on protection and trust
- Psalm 4, Psalm 31:1-6, Scripture, Nunc Dimittis, collects
- Especially helpful for those who wake in the night

### When to Pray

**Upon waking:**
- Dedicate the day to God before checking phone
- Morning Prayer aligns with Huberman's morning sunlight protocol
- Creates proper orientation before the day's demands

**During work breaks:**
- Midday prayer (Sext) or brief collects
- Step away from screen, pray standing or walking
- Resets focus and reduces stress

**Before sleep:**
- Night Prayer (Compline)
- Examination of conscience
- Prayer of quiet trust
- Most restful when it's the last activity of the day

**When you can't sleep:**
- The Jesus Prayer: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner"
- Psalm 23, Psalm 4, or Psalm 91
- Intercession for others (turns anxiety outward to love)
- Avoid problem-solving; simply be with God

### Forms of Prayer

**The Jesus Prayer**
- Repeated slowly with breathing
- Ancient Christian practice from the Desert Fathers
- Can be done while walking, working, or resting
- Draws the heart into continual prayer

**Lectio Divina**
- Sacred reading of Scripture
- Not study—listening for God's word to you personally
- 20-30 minutes
- Steps: Read, Reflect, Respond, Rest (Lectio, Meditatio, Oratio, Contemplatio)

**Intercession**
- Prayer for others—family, parish, nation, world
- Particularly powerful during wakeful nights
- "Bear one another's burdens" (Galatians 6:2)
- Written prayer lists help focus the mind

**Confession**
- Daily examination: Where did I fall short today?
- General Confession in Morning/Evening Prayer
- Specific sins to God in private prayer
- Freedom from guilt aids sleep and peace

### Benefits Distinct from Secular Practices

**Formation:**
- Shapes desires toward God
- Trains attention on what is eternal
- Builds virtue over time

**Communion:**
- Union with God, not just relaxation
- Participating in Christ's intercession
- "Prayer is the life of the soul" (St. Teresa)

**Redemption:**
- Acknowledgment of sin and need for grace
- Reconciliation through confession
- Assurance of forgiveness

**Hope:**
- Anchored in God's promises
- Not merely mood regulation—eschatological confidence
- Peace that surpasses understanding

### Practical Implementation

**Start small:**
- One office per day to begin (Morning Prayer recommended)
- Use an app (Venite) or printed BCP
- Follow the structure—don't improvise early on

**Build habit:**
- Same time daily
- Same location if possible
- Prepare the space the night before (Bible, prayer book, candle)

**Sabbath rest:**
- Sunday as a different kind of day
- Extended prayer, corporate worship
- No fitness tracking, minimal screens
- Physical and spiritual rest integrated

**Family/household:**
- Pray offices together when possible
- Children can join in shorter forms
- Creates shared spiritual rhythm

## Light Exposure Protocols

### Morning Light

**Most critical protocol for circadian health:**

| Condition | Duration | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Sunny | 5 min | Outdoor light |
| Partly cloudy | 10 min | Still much brighter than indoors |
| Overcast | 20-30 min | Even cloudy days are ~10x brighter than indoor lights |
| Very overcast | 30-60 min | Use lux meter app to verify |

**Guidelines:**
- Within 1 hour of waking (ideally 30-60 min)
- No sunglasses (if safe)
- Contacts/glasses fine
- Never look through windows (filters wavelengths)
- Outdoor > SAD lamp > indoor lights

### Early Risers (Before Sunrise)

- Turn on as many indoor lights as possible before sun rises
- Go outside immediately once sun is up

### Late Afternoon Light

- View sunlight in late afternoon before sunset (second exposure)
- Helps set circadian anchor for evening
- Reduces sensitivity to artificial light later

### Artificial Light at Night

**The rule:** As dim as safely possible 10pm-4am

**Hierarchy of harm:**
- Overhead bright lights: Most harmful
- Lights low in room: Less harmful
- Blue blockers: Helpful but not solution
- Candlelight/firelight: Fine
- Darkness: Ideal

**Why it matters:**
- Bright light between 10pm-4am disrupts circadian clock
- Suppresses melatonin
- Disrupts dopamine and other neuromodulators
- Affects mood, learning, metabolism, immunity

## Focus & Productivity Protocols

### Getting Alert (Pre-Work)

**Breathing Protocol:**
1. 25-30 deep breaths (in through nose, out through mouth)
2. Exhale fully and hold breath 15-60 seconds (lungs empty)
3. Inhale once and hold briefly
4. Breathe normally when you feel impulse to breathe

**Purpose:** Increases epinephrine (adrenaline) for alertness

### Visual Focus

**Protocol:**
- Stare at one spot for 30-60 seconds before starting work
- Blink as needed
- Mental focus follows visual focus

**Why it works:**
- Engages top-down attentional circuits
- Involves acetylcholine release
- Takes effort — that's the engagement

### Work Session Structure

**Optimal session length:** 90 minutes or less

**Why:**
- Adults can sustain unbroken attention for max ~3 minutes on average
- Expect focus to flicker — this is normal
- 90 min matches ultradian rhythms

**Best cognitive window:** Within 8 hours after waking

### Environment Setup

- Keep screen at or above eye level (promotes alertness)
- Phone off and out of room
- Close non-essential browser tabs
- Turn off internet if possible
- Use background sounds if helpful: white/pink/brown noise, binaural beats

---

## Neuroplasticity Super-Protocol (Learning)

### 1. Get Alert

Use breathing protocol (above) or caffeine before learning bout.

### 2. Get Focused

Stare at one spot 30-60 seconds. Mental focus follows visual focus.

### 3. Generate Repetitions

- Maximum safe repetitions in learning bout
- Work slightly faster than reflexive pace (prevents mind wandering)
- Errors are expected and valuable

### 4. Expect & Embrace Errors

- ~15% error rate is optimal for learning
- Errors increase alertness and neural plasticity
- When you mess up, capitalize on it with another attempt immediately

### 5. Insert Micro-Rest Intervals (Random)

- Randomly pause 10 seconds every ~2 minutes
- During pause, neurons replay patterns 10x faster than during activity
- Similar mechanism to deep sleep
- Don't time it exactly — random distribution is key

### 6. Random Intermittent Reward

- Don't reward/predictably celebrate every success
- Make rewards random (like casinos)
- Predictable rewards lose motivational impact quickly
- This maintains dopamine baseline better

### 7. Limit Sessions to 90 Minutes

- 90 min is maximum for intense focus
- Space intense bouts 2-3+ hours apart
- Most people can't do more than 270 min of intense learning per day

### 8. Post-Learning NSDR

- Within 1 hour of learning bout
- Do 10-30 min NSDR/Yoga Nidra
- Enhances rate and depth of learning
- Neural rewiring happens during rest/sleep

### 9. Sleep

- The actual neural rewiring occurs during sleep
- Learning bout is the trigger; sleep is when it happens
- Aim for consistent, sufficient deep sleep

### Post-Learning Enhancement

**Cold exposure after learning may improve retention:**
- Spike in adrenaline post-learning helps consolidate memory
- Brief cold exposure (30-60 seconds) after learning session

## Motivation & Dopamine Management

### Understanding Dopamine

- Dopamine is the molecule of **craving and motivation**, not pleasure
- Motivation level = current dopamine baseline
- Large spikes cause subsequent baseline drops until replenished

### The Problem with Layering Dopamine

**Don't layer too many dopamine sources if you want consistent motivation:**
- Exercise + caffeine + music + pre-workout + social media + etc.
- Each adds to the spike
- Results in bigger crash afterward

**Better approach:**
- Be mindful of dopamine sources
- Sometimes do the "hard thing" without extra stimulation
- Build intrinsic motivation (the process itself)

### Random Intermittent Reinforcement

**Most effective reward schedule for maintaining motivation:**
- Celebrate wins, but not all of them
- Make it unpredictable
- This prevents dopamine desensitization

### Process Over Outcome

- Dopamine release is partially mindset-controlled
- Focus on the process, not just the end goal
- This sustains motivation longer

### Get Good Sleep

- Sleep deprivation devastates dopamine systems
- Impacts motivation, reward processing, decision-making

---

## Goal Setting Protocols

### How to Set Goals

**1. Visualize the Big Win**
- Get the process started with clear vision of success
- But also visualize consequences of failure to maintain motivation

**2. Set Moderately Lofty Goals**
- Achievable but not easy
- 1-3 major goals per year maximum

**3. Concrete Definition**
- End goal clearly defined
- Steps to achieve it clearly defined
- No vague aspirations

**4. Regular Assessment**
- Assess progress regularly (e.g., once per week)
- Stay motivated through visible progress

---

## Alcohol Protocols

### Health Risks

- 1-2 drinks per day average associated with:
  - Thinning of neocortex
  - Increased impulsivity
  - Increased baseline cortisol
  - Reduced mood
  - Increased cancer risk
  - Lower testosterone
- Less alcohol = fewer risks; more alcohol = greater risks

### Hangover Mitigation

- **Electrolytes before drinking** can reduce hangover severity
- **Cold exposure after drinking** (spiking adrenaline) helps alleviate hangovers

### General Rule

- Less is better for health and performance
- Occasional use is fine, but regular daily use has measurable negative impacts

---

## Cannabis Protocols

### Strains

**Sativa:** Stimulant effect
- Increases creativity, energy, focus
- Reduces pain

**Indica:** "Full body" effect
- Promotes relaxation
- Helps relieve anxiety

**Hybrid:** Blend of both

### Risks & Warnings

**Use before age 25:**
- Negatively impacts brain development
- Thins gray matter in frontal lobe
- Long-term impact on executive function
- Increases risk of depression and anxiety
- Increases risk of psychosis (for genetically predisposed)

**Chronic use:**
- All risks of smoking/vaping
- May increase baseline anxiety
- Depression increases over time with chronic use (especially if not depressed when starting)

**Recommendation:**
- Avoid entirely if under 25
- If using, be aware of frequency and mental health impacts

---

## Gut Microbiome Protocols

### Key Principles

- Gut health affects both mental and physical health
- "Second brain" — gut-brain axis is real and powerful

### Protocols

**Incorporate:**
- 25g+ fiber per day
- Low-sugar fermented foods (sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, yogurt)
- Diverse whole foods

**Avoid:**
- Too much processed food
- Excessive sugar (feeds bad bacteria)

**Support with:**
- Good sleep
- Regular exercise
- Stress management

---

## Hydration Protocols

### Water Quality

- Filter tap water (preferably removes fluoride)
- Avoid plastic water bottles (plastic leaches into water over time)
- Hard water (high calcium/magnesium) may benefit cardiovascular health

### Daily Intake

- Aim for ~80 oz within 10 hours of waking
- This helps avoid dehydration throughout day

### During Exercise

- Electrolytes help offset dehydration
- Important for performance and recovery

---

## Testosterone Optimization (Men)

### Supplements

**Tongkat Ali:** 400mg/day
- Reduces sex hormone binding globulin
- Increases androgen release
- Raises testosterone
- Take early in day (stimulant effect)
- Works better with chronic use (effects from month 2-3)
- No need to cycle

**Fadogia Agrestis:** 425mg/day
- Acts as luteinizing hormone mimetic
- Stimulates testosterone production
- Can increase total testosterone ~200 points
- **Must cycle:** 8 weeks on/2 weeks off OR 12 weeks on/1 month off (potential toxicity at high doses)

**Boron:** 5-12mg/day
- Lowers sex hormone binding globulin
- Boosts testosterone levels

**Vitamin D:**
- Supplement if deficient to optimize testosterone

**Creatine:** 5g/day
- Increases total testosterone
- Increases conversion to DHT
- Aids amino acid synthesis

**Ashwagandha:**
- Modestly increases testosterone
- Reduces stress hormones
- Aids sleep
- Increases lean mass

### Warning: Turmeric

- **Excess turmeric inhibits testosterone → DHT conversion**
- DHT crucial for strength, recovery, libido
- Moderate amounts okay; avoid excessive intake

---

## Longevity Protocols

### Foundations

1. **Exercise regularly** — see fitness protocols
2. **Get good sleep** — see sleep toolkit
3. **Eat healthy diet** — see nutrition guidelines
4. **Maintain muscle mass** — ensures functional aging
5. **Minimize chronic inflammation** — reduces age-related disease risk

### Supplements (Emerging Evidence)

**NAD+ and Resveratrol:**
- May increase longevity
- Research still unclear
- Consider if interested in anti-aging

### Stress Management

- Chronic stress = chronic inflammation
- Use NSDR, meditation, exercise, social connection
- Don't neglect mental health

## Key Principles Across All Protocols

1. **Consistency > Intensity** — Most protocols work through regular practice, not heroic efforts
2. **Timing Matters** — Light, caffeine, exercise, cold/heat all have optimal timing windows
3. **Sleep is Non-Negotiable** — Nearly every protocol references sleep as foundational
4. **Safety First** — Especially with cold/heat exposure, start conservatively
5. **Individual Variation** — These are starting points; adjust to your response
6. **Stack Gradually** — Don't implement everything at once; add one protocol at a time

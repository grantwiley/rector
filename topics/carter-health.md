# Carter's Health & Fertility Protocols

*Female hormone health, fertility optimization, and preconception wellness*

## Hormone Health Fundamentals

### The Female Hormonal Landscape

Women operate on a monthly rhythm, not a daily one. Understanding this changes everything about health optimization.

**Key hormones:**
- **Estrogen:** Dominant in follicular phase; builds uterine lining, supports bone health, mood, libido
- **Progesterone:** Dominant in luteal phase; maintains pregnancy, calms nervous system, raises body temp
- **Testosterone:** Present in smaller amounts; supports libido, muscle, confidence
- **Cortisol:** Stress hormone — the #1 fertility disruptor when chronically elevated

### Cycle Tracking (Foundation)

**Why track:**
- Confirms ovulation (required for fertility)
- Identifies hormone imbalances early
- Optimizes timing for conception
- Explains energy/mood fluctuations

**Methods:**
1. **Basal body temperature (BBT)** — Take temp immediately upon waking; rise of 0.5-1°F confirms ovulation
2. **Cervical mucus monitoring** — Egg white consistency = fertile window
3. **Ovulation predictor kits (OPKs)** — Detect LH surge 24-48 hours before ovulation
4. **Apps:** Kindara, Ovia, Fertility Friend

**What a healthy cycle looks like:**
- Length: 26-32 days
- Period: 3-7 days, moderate flow
- Ovulation: Day 14 ± 2 days
- BBT rise: Clear, sustained
- Luteal phase: 12-14 days

## Preconception Health Checklist

### 6-12 Months Before Trying to Conceive

**Medical:**
- [ ] Preconception visit with OB/GYN or midwife
- [ ] Bloodwork: CBC, iron/ferritin, vitamin D, TSH (thyroid), B12, folate
- [ ] Check MTHFR gene status (affects folate metabolism)
- [ ] Dental checkup (gum disease linked to preterm birth)
- [ ] Review medications with doctor
- [ ] Confirm vaccinations current (MMR, varicella if needed)

**Lifestyle:**
- [ ] Eliminate alcohol (fetal alcohol risk starts before you know you're pregnant)
- [ ] Stop smoking/vaping
- [ ] Audit personal care products (endocrine disruptors)
- [ ] Switch to glass/stainless for food storage (avoid plastics)
- [ ] Filter water (remove chlorine, fluoride if desired)
- [ ] Reduce caffeine to <200mg/day (1-2 cups coffee)

**Nutrition:**
- [ ] Start prenatal vitamin with methylfolate (not folic acid)
- [ ] Optimize iron stores (ferritin >50 ng/mL)
- [ ] Vitamin D >40 ng/mL
- [ ] Omega-3 supplementation (DHA for fetal brain)
- [ ] Build nutrient density for 6+ months

**Fitness:**
- [ ] Establish consistent routine (3-4x/week)
- [ ] Build pelvic floor strength
- [ ] Achieve healthy body composition (not extreme)
- [ ] Include stress-reducing movement (yoga, walking)

## Sleep for Female Hormones

Women have different sleep architecture than men. Hormonal fluctuations affect sleep quality significantly.

### Luteal Phase Sleep Challenges

**Why it's harder:**
- Progesterone raises core body temperature
- More fragmented sleep
- More vivid dreams
- Some experience insomnia

**Solutions:**
- Keep room cooler (65-68°F)
- Magnesium glycinate 400mg before bed
- L-theanine 200mg
- Limit fluids 2 hours before bed (progesterone is diuretic)

### Menstrual Phase

**Honor the rest:**
- Many women need 30-60 min more sleep
- Don't schedule demanding workouts
- Prioritize restoration

### General Sleep Protocol

**Non-negotiables:**
- 8-9 hours in bed (women need more than men)
- Consistent wake time (sets circadian rhythm)
- Complete darkness (blackout curtains)
- Cool room (65-68°F)
- No screens 1 hour before bed (or blue light filters)

**Huberman sleep stack adapted for women:**
- Magnesium threonate or bisglycinate: 200-400mg
- Apigenin: 50mg (chamomile extract)
- Theanine: 200-400mg
- Myo-inositol: 2-4g (also supports fertility/egg quality)

**Avoid:**
- Melatonin (disrupts natural production, may affect ovulation)
- GABA (limited evidence, potential dependency)

---

## Stress Management (Critical for Fertility)

### The Cortisol-Fertility Connection

**Why stress kills fertility:**
- Cortisol signals "danger" — body delays reproduction
- Can suppress ovulation (hypothalamic amenorrhea)
- Shortens luteal phase
- Reduces progesterone production
- Impacts egg quality

**Not "just relax":** Stress physiology is real and measurable.

### Daily Stress Protocol

**Morning (5-10 min):**
- Morning prayer or meditation before checking phone
- Sunlight exposure (Huberman protocol)
- Set intention for the day

**Throughout day:**
- Breathing breaks: 5 breaths, 5 times daily
- Box breathing (4 counts in/hold/out/hold) for acute stress
- Physiological sigh (Huberman): two inhales through nose, long exhale through mouth

**Evening (20-30 min):**
- Yoga Nidra or NSDR (non-sleep deep rest)
- Legs up the wall pose (parasympathetic activation)
- Compline (Night Prayer) from BCP

**Weekly:**
- 1-2 sessions yoga or tai chi
- Nature time (forest bathing if possible)
- Social connection (dinner with friends, calls with family)

### Adaptogens for Stress (Safe for Fertility)

- **Ashwagandha:** 300-600mg daily — reduces cortisol, supports thyroid
- **Rhodiola:** 200-400mg — energy and stress resilience
- **Holy basil (Tulsi):** Teas or supplements — calming, balances blood sugar

**Cycle:** 8-12 weeks on, 2-4 weeks off

---

## Light Exposure Protocols

### Morning Light (Critical)

**Same as Grant's protocol but even more important for women:**
- Within 30-60 min of waking
- 10-30 min outside (depending on cloud cover)
- Sets cortisol rhythm, which sets everything else
- No sunglasses (if safe)

### Evening Light

**Protect melatonin:**
- Dim lights after sunset
- Use blue light filters/screens after dark
- No bright overhead lights after 10pm
- Candles/firelight are fine

**Special consideration:** Some women are more light-sensitive in luteal phase. Be extra diligent then.

## Common Fertility-Related Issues

### Thyroid Health

**Thyroid problems are underdiagnosed in women:**
- Subclinical hypothyroidism affects fertility
- Optimal TSH: 1.0-2.5 (not just "in range")
- Check: TSH, free T4, free T3, thyroid antibodies

**Signs of low thyroid:**
- Cold intolerance
- Constipation
- Hair loss
- Low energy
- Weight gain
- Irregular cycles

**Support:**
- Adequate iodine (not excessive)
- Selenium (Brazil nuts: 2-3/day)
- Zinc
- Vitamin D
- Work with doctor if medicated

### Iron Status

**Ferritin targets for fertility:**
- Minimum: 30 ng/mL
- Optimal: 50-100 ng/mL
- Pregnancy requirement: Higher

**Why it matters:**
- Oxygen delivery to ovaries and uterus
- Egg quality
- Prevents anemia in pregnancy

**Food sources:**
- Red meat (best absorbed)
- Liver (very high, 1x/week)
- Spinach, lentils (plant iron — less absorbed)
- Pair plant iron with vitamin C

**Supplement:**
- Bisglycinate form (gentler on stomach)
- 25-50mg every other day if needed
- Take with vitamin C, away from calcium/coffee/tea

### Vitamin D

**Target:** 40-60 ng/mL (higher end for fertility)

**Why it matters:**
- Hormone synthesis (it's actually a hormone)
- Egg quality
- Implantation
- Immune function

**Supplement:**
- D3: 2,000-5,000 IU daily (based on blood levels)
- Take with fat-containing meal
- Recheck levels every 3-6 months

### MTHFR Gene Variant

**What it is:**
- 40-50% of population has variant
- Affects folate metabolism
- Can increase miscarriage risk

**Solution:**
- Take methylfolate (5-MTHF) not folic acid
- Avoid folic acid-fortified foods if possible
- Support methylation with B12, B6, choline
- Check homocysteine levels

- Triclosan (antibacterial)
- Oxybenzone (sunscreen)

**Use instead:**
- Fragrance-free or essential oil-scented
- Mineral sunscreens (zinc oxide)
- Clean beauty brands
- Apps: Think Dirty, EWG Skin Deep

### Household Products

**Avoid:**
- Synthetic air fresheners
- Fabric softeners
- Non-stick cookware (PFOA/PFAS)
- Harsh cleaners

**Switch to:**
- Essential oil diffusers
- Cast iron or stainless steel cookware
- Vinegar/baking soda cleaning
- Indoor plants (natural air filtration)

## Glucose Management for Fertility

### Blood Sugar & Hormones

**Insulin resistance = fertility enemy:**
- Drives PCOS (most common cause of infertility)
- Disrupts ovulation
- Increases miscarriage risk
- Affects egg quality

**Even non-PCOS women:** Optimal glucose control supports hormone balance.

### Huberman/Attia Protocols Adapted

**Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM):**
- Worthwhile for 2-4 weeks to understand patterns
- Same cost/benefit as for men
- Women may see more fluctuation across cycle

**Targets:**
- Fasting glucose: 70-90 mg/dL
- Post-meal peak: <140 mg/dL (ideally <120)
- Time in range: >90%

**Strategies:**
- Eat protein/fiber first at meals
- Walk 10-20 min after eating
- Limit refined carbs, especially alone
- Front-load carbs earlier in day
- 1-2 tbsp vinegar before carb-heavy meals

### Signs of Blood Sugar Issues

- Energy crashes
- Sugar cravings
- Difficulty losing weight
- Acne (especially jawline)
- Irregular periods
- Mood swings

## Additional Therapies to Consider

### Acupuncture

**Evidence:**
- Reduces stress
- May improve blood flow to uterus/ovaries
- Some studies show improved pregnancy rates with IVF
- Safe and low-risk

**When to start:** 3 months before trying to conceive

### Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy

**Not just for problems — preventive:**

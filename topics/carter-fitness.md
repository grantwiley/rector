# Carter's Fitness Protocol

*Female-specific training adapted from Huberman/Attia protocols, optimized for fertility and preconception health*

## Carter's Stats & Goals

- **Current:** 135 lbs, 5'5½" (66.5 inches)
- **Goal:** Maintain healthy body composition, build functional strength for motherhood
- **Approach:** Moderate, sustainable — this is not a deficit phase
- **Protein target:** 80-110g/day (0.6-0.8g per lb)
- **Focus:** Hormone health, core strength, pelvic floor, metabolic fitness

## Training Philosophy for Fertility

**The female athlete triad warning:** Overtraining + under-fueling = amenorrhea (loss of period) and fertility problems. Carter's training prioritizes:

1. **Adequate fuel** — Never training fasted, sufficient calories
2. **Moderate volume** — 3-4 sessions/week maximum
3. **Cycle awareness** — Adjust intensity to menstrual phase
4. **Recovery first** — Rest is when adaptations happen

### Menstrual Cycle Training Adjustments

| Phase | Days | Hormone State | Training Focus |
|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Menstrual** | 1-5 | Low hormones | Light movement, yoga, walking — honor rest needs |
| **Follicular** | 6-14 | Estrogen rising | Higher intensity, strength PRs, cardio capacity |
| **Ovulation** | ~14 | Peak estrogen/testosterone | Strongest training window — lift heavy, push intensity |
| **Luteal** | 15-28 | Progesterone dominant | Moderate intensity, focus on form, reduce volume if needed |

**Note:** Every woman is different. Some feel terrible in luteal phase; others feel fine. Adjust based on energy, not rigid rules.

## Weekly Structure

| Day | Focus | Duration | Notes |
|-----|-------|----------|-------|
| **Day 1** | Full Body Strength | 45-50 min | Compound lifts, moderate weight |
| **Day 2** | Zone 2 Cardio | 30-40 min | Conversational pace — fertility loves Zone 2 |
| **Day 3** | Rest or Light Yoga | 20-30 min | Pelvic floor work, mobility |
| **Day 4** | Upper Body & Core | 40-45 min | Push/pull + deep core activation |
| **Day 5** | Zone 2 or Rest | 20-30 min | Optional based on energy |
| **Day 6** | Lower Body + Glutes | 45-50 min | Squat/hinge patterns, posterior chain |
| **Day 7** | Complete Rest | — | Prioritize sleep, recovery |

**Maximum:** 4 hard sessions per week. The other days are rest or gentle movement.

## Fertility-Specific Training Elements

### Core & Pelvic Floor (Critical)

**Why it matters:**
- Pregnancy requires massive core strength
- Labor demands pelvic floor control
- Postpartum recovery depends on pre-pregnancy foundation
- Prevents diastasis recti, incontinence, prolapse

**Daily (5-10 min):**
- **360° breathing:** Inhale expand ribs/back, exhale gentle pelvic floor lift
- **Dead bug:** 2 sets of 8-10 reps
- **Bird dog:** 2 sets of 8-10 reps
- **Modified curl-up:** 2 sets of 5-8 reps

**2-3x/week:**
- **Side plank:** 2 sets of 20-30 sec/side
- **Glute bridge:** 2 sets of 12-15 reps
- **Farmer carries:** 2 sets of 30-40 meters

**Resources:**
- Read: *The Core Solution* by Dr. Chloe Cicely
- Watch: "The Perfect Pelvic Floor" by Dr. Kelly Alford
- Consider: Pelvic floor physical therapy assessment before pregnancy

### Hip Mobility (Labor Prep)

**Daily:**
- **90/90 hip switch:** 10 reps
- **Cossack squat:** 2 sets of 8/side
- **Hip circles:** 10 each direction

---

## Zone 2 Cardio for Fertility

**Why Zone 2 matters for women:**
- Improves insulin sensitivity (PCOS protection)
- Reduces inflammation
- Supports hormone clearance and balance
- Builds mitochondrial health without stress

### Protocol

| Weekly Target | Per Session | Best Modalities |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **120-150 min/week** | 30-40 min | Walking, cycling, swimming |

**Fertility-specific notes:**
- Walking is ideal — low stress, supports circulation to reproductive organs
- Avoid overtraining — excess cortisol disrupts ovulation
- Keep heart rate conversational — if you can't talk, you're too high

## Strength Training Guidelines

### Rep Ranges

| Goal | Reps | Rest | Application |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| **Strength** | 5-8 reps | 2-3 min | Compound lifts (squat, deadlift, press) |
| **Hypertrophy** | 8-12 reps | 90 sec | Accessory work |
| **Endurance/Stability** | 12-15 reps | 60 sec | Core, pelvic floor, prehab |

### Exercise Selection

**Lower Body (2x/week):**
- Goblet squats or front squats
- Romanian deadlifts
- Hip thrusts
- Step-ups or lunges
- Clamshells or banded lateral walks (glute medius)

**Upper Body (1-2x/week):**
- Push-ups or dumbbell press
- Rows (cable or dumbbell)
- Lat pulldowns or pull-ups (assisted)
- Face pulls (posture)
- Overhead press

**Core/Pelvic Floor (Every session):**
- 360° breathing
- Dead bug
- Side plank
- Pallof press (anti-rotation)

## What to Avoid

### Training Practices That Harm Fertility

1. **Chronic calorie restriction** — Amenorrhea risk
2. **Training fasted** — Cortisol spike, hormone disruption
3. **Excessive volume** — >5 hard sessions/week can disrupt cycles
4. **No rest days** — Recovery is when hormones balance
5. **Ignoring cycle signals** — Pushing through extreme fatigue

### Intensity Guidelines

**Maximum effort:**
- 1-2 true high-intensity sessions per week maximum
- VO2 max work is fine but keep it brief (20 min total)
- Never multiple hard days in a row

**Signs to back off:**
- Missing or irregular periods
- Persistent fatigue
- Sleep disruption
- Low libido
- Mood changes (irritability, anxiety)

## Preconception Fitness Checklist

**Before pregnancy:**
- [ ] Can perform 10 full push-ups
- [ ] Can deadlift bodyweight for 5 reps
- [ ] Can squat bodyweight for 5 reps
- [ ] Can hold plank for 60 seconds
- [ ] Can walk 5 miles without fatigue
- [ ] No pelvic floor dysfunction (leaking, pain, heaviness)
- [ ] Consistent menstrual cycles

**These benchmarks:**
- Predict easier pregnancy
- Reduce labor complications
- Speed postpartum recovery
- Build confidence for motherhood demands

## Supplements for Training Performance

### Pre-Workout

- **Caffeine:** Optional, 100mg max (sensitivity varies)
- **Creatine monohydrate:** 3-5g daily — safe for fertility, supports brain/muscle
- **Citrulline malate:** 6-8g for blood flow (optional)

**Avoid:**
- High-stim pre-workouts (stress hormones)
- Testosterone boosters (obviously)
- Fat burners (metabolic stress)

### Post-Workout

- **Protein:** 25-30g within 1-2 hours
- **Carbohydrates:** Include for hormone support (sweet potato, fruit, rice)

---

## Recovery Priorities

### Sleep

**Non-negotiable:** 8-9 hours per night

- Growth hormone pulses during sleep support fertility
- Sleep deprivation = cortisol = disrupted ovulation
- Prioritize over early morning workouts if needed

### Stress Management

- **Daily:** 10 min meditation or prayer
- **Weekly:** 1-2 sessions of yoga or gentle stretching
- **Monthly:** Massage or bodywork if possible
- **Always:** Protect rest days — they're hormone recovery days

### Cold & Heat

**Cold exposure:**
- Brief (1-2 min) post-workout is fine
- Avoid chronic cold stress (disrupts thyroid)
- Not recommended during luteal phase (progesterone is thermogenic)

**Heat exposure:**
- Sauna is fine pre-conception (3-4x/week, 15-20 min)
- Stop once pregnant (risk of neural tube defects in early pregnancy)
- Lower temperature preferred (160-170°F vs 190°F+)

---

## Implementation Notes

### Starting Point

If new to consistent training:
1. **Month 1:** 2-3 sessions/week, learn movements, build habit
2. **Month 2:** Add Zone 2 cardio, increase to 3-4 sessions
3. **Month 3+:** Progressive overload, cycle-based adjustments

### During Pregnancy Planning

- Maintain current routine until pregnancy confirmed
- Then: Continue with modifications (see pregnancy resources)
- Most women can train throughout pregnancy with adjustments
- Pelvic floor physical therapy is gold standard prep

### Working with Grant

- Coordinate meal prep and schedules
- Share recovery priorities (early bedtimes, rest days)
- Consider couple walks for Zone 2 + relationship time
- Respect different needs (he's building, she's maintaining)

## Key Observations

1. **~$30k/yr is unaccounted for** — Between "Uncategorized" ($19k), "Checks Unknown" ($10k), and Amazon ($8k), roughly $37k in spending has no real categorization. This is the #1 thing to fix.
2. **Amazon is $654/mo** — 216 purchases in a year. Some is household essentials, but at ~$36/avg per order across 18/mo, there's likely waste.
3. **Restaurants are reasonable** at $199/mo for a married couple.
4. **Groceries are ~$991/mo** — High but includes Costco bulk runs and a co-op. Worth tracking whether this includes non-food items.
5. **Surplus is real but fragile** — $2,898/mo net is good, but months with travel or big purchases (Sep, Jul) nearly wipe it out.
6. **Checks need tracking** — $822/mo in checks with no description. These are likely rent/mortgage, church, or farm-related but need labeling.

## Action Items
- [ ] Clean up Monarch categories (or build a better local categorizer)
- [ ] Identify what the unknown checks are going to
- [ ] Set a monthly Amazon budget and track against it
- [ ] Define savings targets (emergency fund size, monthly savings goal)
- [ ] Start tracking net worth (account balances over time)

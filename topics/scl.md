## Accreditation (PATH Program)

SCL launched its accreditation program in 2024 to provide formal validation of school quality and a clear framework for growth.

### The PATH Approach
**P**rincipled — Standards-based but not prescriptive  
**A**spirational — Idealistic standards that inspire improvement  
**T**horough — Comprehensive 80-indicator assessment  
**H**ospitable — Supportive process, not punitive

### The Eight Standards
1. **Christian Commitment** — Alignment of philosophy and practice with Christian faith
2. **Classical Commitment** — Manifestation of liberal arts tradition
3. **School Culture** — Embodiment of classical and Christian identity
4. **Student Experience** — Daily experience reflecting school commitments
5. **Governance** — Disciplined governance model for long-term viability
6. **Executive Leadership** — Leaders with character, competence, and capacity
7. **Finances and Facilities** — Fiscal responsibility and resource alignment
8. **Advancement** — Mission advancement through communication and fundraising

### Accreditation Process
1. Express interest (submit inquiry)
2. Engage with SCL community (conferences, events)
3. Become SCL member (prerequisite)
4. Prepare (self-assessments, documents, consultation)
5. Apply (submit application, receive roadmap)
6. On-site visit (interviews, focus groups, observations)
7. Receive PATHway to Thriving Report (commendations + recommendations)

### Dual Accreditation
Partnership with Middle States Association (MSA-CESS) allows schools to receive dual accreditation. SCL serves as lead accreditor using SCL standards; MSA provides state-level recognition (including ESA fund access). No second self-study or visit required.

### Accredited Schools (Current)

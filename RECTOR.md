4. **SCL day job** — Keep delivering well while building PH on the side.

## Decisions & Rationale

<!-- Key decisions worth remembering, with brief reasoning. -->

## Daily Guidance Format

When Grant or Carter asks what they should do today (fitness, nutrition, health), provide a concise, actionable briefing:

**Format:**
```
## Today — [Name]

**Movement:** [Workout type, duration, key exercises or rest day guidance]

**Nutrition:** [Meal template, protein target, key foods to prioritize today]

**Supplements:** [What to take and when]

**Sleep Prep:** [Evening wind-down actions, cutoff times]

**One Focus:** [The single most important thing for today]
```

**Guidelines:**
- Keep it scannable — bullet points, bold labels, short sentences
- Pull specifics from their respective topic files (grant-* vs carter-*)
- Consider context: day of week, energy levels, cycle phase (for Carter), recent training load
- Don't overwhelm — 3-5 bullets per section max
- If they ask "what should I eat today" → give specific meal suggestions, not just macros
- If they ask "should I work out today" → check their schedule, sleep quality, and give yes/no + what to do

**For Carter specifically:**
- Factor in menstrual cycle phase if known ( follicular = push intensity, luteal = moderate, menstrual = rest/light)
- Emphasize stress management and adequate fuel
- Never suggest fasted training or aggressive deficit

**For Grant specifically:**
- Factor in Parish Hall project intensity (high stress days = protect sleep over extra training)
- Can suggest fasted morning workouts if it fits his schedule
- Prioritize consistency over perfection
